                <h3>30-days-of-react-ebook</h3>
                <p>Unlike many of its predecessors, React operates not directly on the browser's
                    Document Object Model (DOM) immediately, but on a virtual DOM. That is,
                    rather than manipulating the document in a browser after changes to our
                    data (which can be quite slow) it resolves changes on a DOM built and run
                    entirely in memory. After the virtual DOM has been updated, React
                    intelligently determines what changes to make to the actual browser's DOM..

                <h3>React Native for Mobile Development 2nd Edition</h3>
                <p>React Native took this one step further when first introduced in 2015 and helped
                    build Native iOS apps with common knowledge of web technologies like JavaScript.
                    In just a few years, React Native has become an important player in native mobile
                    development, and extending its support for both Apple iOS and Google Android was a
                    game changer. This required us to write second edition of this book, which covers both
                    platforms end to end to help you create stunning React Native apps.

                <h3>React Native Cookbook</h3>
                <p>You are already familiar with programming and JavaScript in particular. This book
                    assumes you are tackling common software design choices that arise when building
                    native applications. You may be working in your garage on the next great social
                    media platform, or turning a lumbering enterprise system into a zippy mobile experi‐
                    ence. If you’re trying to bring a cross-platform native application to market quickly
                    and have chosen React, this book is for you. Every section of the book is rooted in
                    personal experiences building native applications.

                <h3>ReactJS Notes For Professionals</h3>
                <p>React allows us to write components using a domain-specific language called JSX. JSX allows us to
                    write our
                    components using HTML, whilst mixing in JavaScript events. React will internally convert this into a
                    virtual DOM, and
                    will ultimately output our HTML for us.
